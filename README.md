# Datastructures_algorithms
My implementations on some common datastructures using Java as language
NOTE: my work under commit "X-exercises"

Contents:
Every exercise comes with my self assessment, in Finnish.

X1 - Are all interegrs in an array unique - method returns true if are
X2 - Combination of two lists, with integers found from one or both of them without duplicates
X3 - Move all integers greater than given value from list to other
X4 - Finds and returns the last node of binary tree (inner order?)
X5 - Creates a set that takes values from the intersection of exactly two sets from the initial three sets
X6 - Gives information about which sets intersect - returns map with references between all sets that intersect
X7 - Implementation of ring-structure
